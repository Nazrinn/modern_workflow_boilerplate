    <p>This boilerplate also uses a few <a href='https://webpack.js.org/loaders/'>loaders</a> to help Webpack process the code and assets and bundle them for production. Note that Webpack is able to process and make a base optimisation of Web JavaScript files on its own, but that's about it. This app use the following loaders:</p>
    <dt><a href='https://github.com/babel/babel-loader'>Babel Loader</a></dt>
    <dd>Allows Webpack to process ES6 JavaScript into ES5 Javascript.</dd>
    <dt><a href='https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader'>CSS Loader</a> and <a href='https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin'>MiniCssExtractPlugin</a></dt>
    <dd>Allows Webpack to process CSS files and create a separate CSS file for production (since Webpack does not do that on its own).</dd>
    <dt><a href='https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader'>HTML Loader</a></dt>
    <dd>Allows Webpack process to HTML files.</dd>
